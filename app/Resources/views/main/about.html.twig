    <h1>About Libsys</h1>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>This project aims to design a user-friendly system to allow customers and staff members to access information on library materials held,
        both on site and online. Library cataloguing systems need to work with the classification systems used in libraries to ensure that all
        the required information is recorded. Libraries have required cataloguing systems to keep track of the library inventory, from the early
        days of hand-written records to modern computerised database systems. Today's library users are increasingly technology literate
        (Clehane and O'Brien, 2015) and these users have an expectation of access to information via the web or downloadable apps.
        This system will be made up of three levels: a user interface, a database of records and software to communicate between the other two levels.</p>
    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>Libraries in this information-driven age need to make use of currently available technologies to provide the best service to customers.
        The expansion of library holdings into various types of media including music, DVD and eBooks gives rise to the question of how to catalogue
        these items for ease of searching. Modern methods of classification and up-to-date search tools may make this task easier. Further advances
        can be made into integrated information management and cataloguing systems for libraries, providing new or enhanced services for customers
        and staff. Collaborations between various libraries would be better facilitated if the tools in use were easy to integrate, being based
        on similar platforms and using the same terminology (Stack, 2015).</p>
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>The library information system will keep a record of staff and customer details. It will also keep a record of the books in the library
        and track which books are on loan to which customers. The end product will allow users to search for items held in the library catalogue.
        It will allow registered customers to login and view and renew items they have out on loan. Staff members will be able to update user records
        and the catalogue of library materials. </p>
